# Project for Pandemic #

KS mobile app has been developed to track the contact of COVID-19 patients to avoid the spread of COVID-19. Health departments use contact tracing apps to find people who may have met someone with COVID-19. KS app helps to capture data (contacts of COVID-19 Patients) and watch the movement of people to make the process faster and more useful. KS Project has several features:

# Contact Tracing #
When someone is in your Bluetooth range, the app automatically scans that app user and storing information first locally in a device and then stored on the server. When someone is COVID-positive, with the help of their contact information, the app sends an alert message to all those who are in contact with that person.

# Notification #
Sending alert messages to users who are in contact with a COVID-19-positive person.

# Geo-Fencing #
When someone is going to the area that is a red alert area (an area in which COVID-19 patients are present), the app sends an alert message that please be careful you are going to enter the red alert area.

# Contact Tracing Mobile App Overview #
When someone is COVID-positive or in contact of COVID positive patient, with the help of a contact tree, the system identifies the overall contacts of that person.
